The packages are published as a container image, and can be "installed" by simply copying the contents to your rootfs.

```

This project could not have been built without the following libraries or projects. They are either directly used in Sentinel OS or provided a lot of inspiration for the shape of the project:

- [The linux kernel](https://www.kernel.org/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Alpine linux](https://www.alpinelinux.org/) and many others developers and companies.
